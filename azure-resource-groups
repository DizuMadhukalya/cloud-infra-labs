## What is a Resource Group

- Logical container that holds related Azure resources (VMs, databases, storage, etc.)
- All resources must belong to one and only one resource group
- Acts as a management boundary for organizing and controlling resources
- Resources in a group can be in different regions

## Key Characteristics

- Lifecycle management: Deleting a resource group deletes all resources within it
- Access control: Apply RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) at the group level
- Tagging and billing: Tag groups for cost tracking and organization
- Deployment unit: Deploy multiple resources together using templates

## Organization Best Practices

- Group resources by lifecycle (dev, test, prod environments)
- Group by application or project (all resources for one app together)
- Group by department or cost center for billing
- Cannot nest resource groups (flat structure only)

## Important Concepts

- Location metadata: Resource group has a location (stores metadata), but resources inside can be anywhere
- Immutable assignment: Once created, a resource cannot be moved easily between groups (some resources support move)
- Dependencies: Resources can reference resources in other groups
- Locks: Apply delete or read-only locks to prevent accidental changes

## Common Use Cases

- Environment separation: RG-Dev, RG-Test, RG-Prod
- Application isolation: RG-WebApp, RG-Database, RG-Monitoring
- Cost management: Track spending per project or team
