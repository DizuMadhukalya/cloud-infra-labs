# Inter-Directory Provisioning in Hybrid Identities

Inter-directory provisioning ensures users and groups created in on-prem Active Directory are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID.

## How It Works

- Users created in on-prem AD
- Azure AD Connect syncs objects
- Changes reflect automatically in cloud

## Why It’s Important

- Prevents duplicate accounts
- Maintains consistency
- Reduces administrative overhead

## Real-Life Use Case

HR creates a new employee in on-prem AD. Within minutes, the account appears in Entra ID and license assignment automation grants Microsoft 365 access.

## Example

If employee changes department, group membership updates sync automatically.
