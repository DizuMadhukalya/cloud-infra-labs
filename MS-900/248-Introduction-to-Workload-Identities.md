# Introduction to Workload Identities

Workload identities represent non-human identities used by applications, services, containers, and virtual machines.

Microsoft Entra Workload ID secures these identities.

## Why Workload Identities?

Applications need secure authentication to:
- Access databases
- Call APIs
- Access storage
- Interact with Microsoft 365 services

## Example

A web application accesses Azure SQL using workload identity instead of storing passwords.
