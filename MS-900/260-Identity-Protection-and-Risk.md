# Identity Protection and Risk-Based Policies

Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection detects risky sign-ins and compromised accounts.

## Risk Types
- Sign-in risk
- User risk

## Automated Responses
- Force password reset
- Require MFA
- Block access

## Example

If user credentials appear in a data breach, Entra flags user risk and forces password reset.

This proactive approach strengthens identity security posture.
