# Information Protection and Sensitivity Labels

Microsoft Information Protection allows organizations to classify and protect data using sensitivity labels.

## What Sensitivity Labels Do
- Classify documents and emails (Public, Internal, Confidential)
- Apply encryption automatically
- Restrict sharing and access
- Add visual markings (headers, footers, watermarks)

## Use Case
A finance report labeled "Confidential" cannot be forwarded outside the organization.

## Example
When a user labels a Word file as Confidential, sharing options are automatically restricted.
