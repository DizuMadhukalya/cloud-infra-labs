# How SSE Addresses Security Challenges

## 1. Identity-Based Access
Access granted based on identity signals.

## 2. Continuous Monitoring
Access revoked if risk changes.

## 3. Micro-Segmentation
User only accesses specific apps.

## 4. Integrated Conditional Access
Policies apply consistently across internet and private apps.

---

## Example:
If user device becomes non-compliant mid-session:
Access revoked immediately.
