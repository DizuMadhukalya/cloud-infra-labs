# How SSE Addresses Security Challenges

## Identity-Based Access
Access granted based on identity signals.

## Continuous Monitoring
Access revoked if risk changes.

## Micro-Segmentation
User only accesses specific apps.

## Integrated Conditional Access
Policies apply consistently across internet and private apps.

Example:
If user device becomes non-compliant mid-session:
Access revoked immediately.
