# How Microsoft 365 Tools Work Together

Microsoft 365 tools are deeply integrated:

- Teams connects with SharePoint and OneDrive for file sharing
- Outlook integrates with Teams for meetings
- Planner tasks can be accessed within Teams
- Documents created in Word/Excel are stored in OneDrive automatically

This integration reduces friction and improves workflow efficiency.
