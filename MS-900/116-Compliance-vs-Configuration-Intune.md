# Compliance Policies vs Configuration Profiles

## Compliance Policies
Define rules devices must follow (PIN, encryption, OS version).

## Configuration Profiles
Apply settings to devices (WiFi, email, restrictions).

## Use Case
Device without encryption becomes non-compliant and loses access to email.

## Example
Configuration profile pushes VPN settings automatically.
