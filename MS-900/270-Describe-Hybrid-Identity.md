# Describe Hybrid Identity

Hybrid identity allows organizations to integrate on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID to provide seamless authentication across cloud and on-prem resources.

## Why Hybrid Identity Matters

Many enterprises still run legacy applications on-premises while adopting cloud services like Microsoft 365. Hybrid identity ensures:

- Single set of credentials
- Unified authentication experience
- Centralized access management
- Gradual cloud migration

## Key Components

- Azure AD Connect
- Password Hash Synchronization
- Pass-through Authentication
- Federation

## Real-Life Use Case

A manufacturing company runs ERP systems on-premises but uses Teams and SharePoint Online in the cloud. Hybrid identity allows employees to use the same credentials to access both environments.

## Example

Employee logs into Windows domain at office and automatically signs into Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint without re-entering credentials.
