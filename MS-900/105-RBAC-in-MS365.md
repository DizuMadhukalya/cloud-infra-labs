# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Microsoft 365

RBAC ensures admins have only the permissions they need.

## Roles
- Global Admin
- Teams Admin
- Exchange Admin
- SharePoint Admin
- Security Admin

## Use Case
Helpdesk staff resets passwords without having global admin rights.

## Example
Teams Admin manages Teams settings but cannot access SharePoint policies.
