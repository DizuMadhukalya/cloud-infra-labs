# Microsoft Teams as the Central Hub for Teamwork

Microsoft Teams is more than a chat application. It acts as a central hub where communication, collaboration, meetings, file sharing, and task management come together.

Key capabilities:
- Channels for topic-based conversations
- Integration with SharePoint and OneDrive for file storage
- Built-in meeting and calling features
- Integration with Planner, Forms, Lists, and third-party apps

Teams reduces the need to switch between multiple tools and increases productivity by bringing work into one place.
