# Deployment Methods and Update Channels for Microsoft 365 Apps

Microsoft 365 Apps can be deployed and updated using multiple methods depending on organizational size, network design, and management preferences. Understanding both deployment methods and update channels is essential for maintaining secure and up-to-date Office environments.

## Deployment Methods
- Microsoft Intune (cloud-based deployment)
- Configuration Manager (on-premises deployment)
- Office Deployment Tool (ODT) from local or cloud source
- Self-service installation by users from office.com

## Update Channels
- Current Channel
- Monthly Enterprise Channel
- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel

## Use Case
A company with branch offices uses Configuration Manager to deploy from a local distribution point while remote workers install directly from the cloud.

## Example
IT assigns devices to Monthly Enterprise Channel for stability while the test team uses Current Channel for early feature access.
