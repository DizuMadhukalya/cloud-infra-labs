# Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

PIM allows just-in-time elevation of administrative roles.

## Benefits
- Reduces permanent admin access
- Requires approval workflow
- Time-limited elevation
- Audit logging

## Example

An IT admin activates Global Administrator role for 1 hour to perform maintenance.

PIM reduces exposure to privilege misuse.
