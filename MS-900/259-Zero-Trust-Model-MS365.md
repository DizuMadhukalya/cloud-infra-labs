# Zero Trust Model in Microsoft 365

Zero Trust follows three core principles:

1. Verify explicitly
2. Use least privilege access
3. Assume breach

## Implementation in MS365
- Conditional Access policies
- MFA enforcement
- Device compliance validation
- Data encryption
- Continuous monitoring

## Example

A user accessing financial data must authenticate with MFA and use a compliant corporate device.

Zero Trust reduces risk even if credentials are compromised.
