# Azure SLAs and Predictability

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) play a major role in making Azure predictable and reliable.

## What is an SLA?

An SLA is a formal commitment from Microsoft Azure that defines:

- Expected uptime  
- Performance guarantees  
- Compensation for failures  

SLAs help customers understand how dependable a service will be.

## How SLAs Improve Predictability

SLAs provide:

- Clear expectations  
- Measurable performance targets  
- Financial assurance  
- Confidence in cloud services  

---

## Examples of Azure SLAs

| Service | Typical SLA |
|-------|------------|
| Virtual Machines | 99.9% – 99.99% |
| Azure Storage | 99.99% |
| Azure SQL Database | 99.99% |
| Azure App Service | 99.95% |

Higher SLA percentages mean lower expected downtime.

## Composite SLAs

When multiple Azure services are used together, overall availability is calculated as a composite SLA.

Example:

If two services each have 99.9% SLA:

Overall SLA = 99.9% × 99.9% = 99.8%

Understanding this helps in designing predictable architectures.

## Benefits of SLAs

- Better planning  
- Risk management  
- Improved system design  
- Business confidence

## Conclusion

Azure SLAs make cloud operations:

- Transparent  
- Reliable  
- Predictable  

They are a key reason organizations trust Azure for critical workloads.
