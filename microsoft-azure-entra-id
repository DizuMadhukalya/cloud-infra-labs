## Microsoft Azure Entra ID

1) What is Microsoft Entra ID
- Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service (formerly Azure Active Directory/Azure AD)
- Manages user identities and controls access to apps, resources, and services
- Not the same as Windows Server Active Directory (cloud vs on-premises)
- Provides single sign-on (SSO) across Microsoft 365, Azure, and thousands of SaaS apps
- Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access, and identity protection
- Key features: User management, app integration, B2B/B2C scenarios, hybrid identity with on-premises AD

2) Authentication vs Authorization

2.1) Authentication (AuthN)
- What it is: Verifying WHO you are (proving identity)
- Process: Username/password, MFA, biometrics, certificates
- Question answered: "Are you really who you claim to be?"
- Example: Logging into Azure portal with credentials and MFA code

2.2) Authorization (AuthZ)
- What it is: Determining WHAT you can access (permissions/rights)
- Process: Happens after authentication, checks roles and permissions
- Question answered: "What are you allowed to do?"
- Example: After login, checking if you can create VMs or only read resources

2.3) In Practice
- User authenticates → Proves identity with password + MFA
- System authorizes → Checks user's roles/permissions
- Access granted/denied → Based on authorization policies

3) Users, Groups, Roles

3.1) Users
- Individual identities representing people or service principals (apps)
- Each user has unique attributes: email, name, department, job title
- Types: Cloud-only users, synced users (from on-premises AD), guest users (B2B)
- Can be assigned licenses, access rights, and group memberships

3.2) Groups
- Collections of users for easier management
- Security groups: Control access to resources (assign permissions to group vs individual users)
- Microsoft 365 groups: Collaboration with shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint site
- Dynamic groups: Membership based on rules (e.g., all users in Sales department)
- Assigned groups: Manually add/remove members

3.3) Roles
- Define permissions and what actions users can perform
- Azure AD roles: Manage Entra ID resources (Global Admin, User Admin, Password Admin)
- Azure RBAC roles: Manage Azure resources (Owner, Contributor, Reader)
- Custom roles: Create specific permission sets for unique requirements
- Built-in vs Custom: Use built-in roles when possible, create custom for specific needs

4) Best Practice Pattern
  User → Member of Group → Group assigned Role → Role grants Permissions

- Assign roles to groups, not individual users (easier management)
- Use least privilege principle (minimum permissions needed)
- Regular access reviews to remove unnecessary permissions
