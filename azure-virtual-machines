## What is an Azure Virtual Machine

- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering providing on-demand, scalable compute resources
- Virtualized server running in Azure datacenter with choice of OS (Windows/Linux)
- Full control over OS, software, and configurations (unlike PaaS)
- Pay-as-you-go pricing or reserved instances for cost savings
- Supports custom images, extensions, and automated deployments

## VM Sizes
- VMs organized into series based on workload type:
- General Purpose (B, D series)

## Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio
- Good for dev/test, small-medium databases, low-traffic web servers
- Example: B2s, D2s_v5

## Compute Optimized (F series)

- High CPU-to-memory ratio
- Ideal for web servers, application servers, batch processing
- Example: F4s_v2

## Memory Optimized (E, M series)

- High memory-to-CPU ratio
- For relational databases, in-memory analytics, large caches
- Example: E8s_v5

## Storage Optimized (L series)

- High disk throughput and I/O
- Big data, SQL/NoSQL databases, data warehousing
- Example: L8s_v3

## GPU (N series)

- Graphics rendering and deep learning
- AI/ML training, video encoding, gaming
- Example: NC6s_v3

## High Performance Compute (H series)

- Fastest CPUs, optional high-throughput networking
- Simulations, modeling, genomics research
- Example: HB120rs_v3

## Use Cases
- Development & Testing

## Quickly spin up/down environments without hardware investment
- Test across different OS and configurations

## Hosting Applications
- Web applications, APIs, microservices
- Legacy applications requiring specific OS versions

## Disaster Recovery
- Replicate on-premises VMs to Azure for failover scenarios
- Cost-effective standby infrastructure

## Database Hosting
- SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL workloads requiring OS-level control
- When Azure PaaS database services don't meet requirements

## Batch Processing
- Data processing jobs, ETL workloads
- Scale up during processing, scale down when idle

## Extend Datacenter
- Hybrid cloud scenarios with Azure VPN/ExpressRoute
- Burst capacity during peak demand periods
