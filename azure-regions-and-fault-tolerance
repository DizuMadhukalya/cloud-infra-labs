## Azure Region

- Geographical area containing one or more datacenters connected via low-latency network
- Each region is isolated from other regions for compliance and data residency
- Allows you to deploy resources close to users for better performance
- Examples: East US, West Europe, Southeast Asia

## Paired Regions

- Every Azure region is paired with another region within same geography (300+ miles apart)
- Provides disaster recovery and business continuity
- Updates are rolled out sequentially (one region at a time) to minimize downtime
- Data replication options available between pairs
- Example pairs: East US ↔ West US, North Europe ↔ West Europe

## Availability Zones

- Physically separate datacenters within an Azure region (minimum of 3 zones)
- Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking
- Connected through high-speed private fiber networks
- Protects apps and data from datacenter-level failures
- Zone-redundant services replicate across zones automatically

## Fault Tolerance Concept

- System's ability to continue operating despite component failures
- Achieved through redundancy at multiple levels: hardware, datacenter, region
- Strategy: Deploy resources across availability zones (datacenter failure) and paired regions (regional disaster)
- Ensures high availability (99.99%+ uptime SLAs possible)
- Trade-off between cost and resilience level needed
